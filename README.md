# SmartThings AV Input
I created a simple command class around changing AV Inputs for SmartThings.  Often when you enter a media room, you'd like the inputs on a receiver to change.  

Since there is no command class or capability defined for changing tuner inputs, I created this SmartApp as a framework for others to use in their custom implementations.
